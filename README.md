# Air Quality Prediction using ML Models

## Overview
This project analyzes air pollution data using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling to assess pollution levels.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning models for prediction
- Visualizations of pollution trends

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Airpollution.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, analyze trends, and build models.

## Dataset
The dataset includes air quality measurements such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and SO2 levels.
